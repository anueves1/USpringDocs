# About

The perfect AAA quality procedural animation system for your game!

_uNimate_ is a powerful procedural animation system on the Asset Store, it is built by using the newest features that the [Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS)](https://unity.com/dots) has brought to the table. 

By leveraging the power of ECS and the new Burst compiler, we have built a robust, and easily extensible procedural animation system featuring a variety of different utility scripts that will allow you to get your procedural animations up and running!
